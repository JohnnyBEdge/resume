    <p class="title">About Me</p>
    <hr width = "20%">

    <p>I am currently a Utah transplant originating from Florida.
    In 2012, I graduated with a degree in health sciences from the University of Central
    Florida and left to teach English in Vietnam. Three years and
    two countries later, I returned to the US so my girlfriend could
    start her PhD in chemistry while I sorted out what to do in life.
    After some trials and errors, I re-discovered web design/programming,
    something I had taken a class while in high school. I am now on the path
    to be a self-taught, front end developer. When I'm not working
    my current job or staring at a computer screen, I love getting
    out in the mountains to hike or (preferably) climb. I have also
     been skateboarding for more than half my life and still like
     to feel the concrete erase away my skin from time to time.
