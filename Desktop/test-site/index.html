      , was a custom bike shop that was exclusively owned and ran by Westerners. Based in Hanoi,
      it all started with a few friends that loved anything with an engine. Initially renting a space to
      service and customize their bikes, they used past experience with car builds with inspiration from custom
      bikes around the world and decided to offer their services to the expats and locals.
      What set them apart was not only the most original and badass bikes of Hanoi, but also the honesty and
      quality that came with them, a rarity in Vietnam.
