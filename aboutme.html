<p> I am currently a Utah transplant originating from Florida.
  In 2012, I graduated with a degree in health sciences from the University of Central
  Florida and left to teach English in Vietnam. Three years and
  two countries later, I returned to the US so my girlfriend could
  start her PhD in chemistry while I sorted out what to do in life.
  After some trials and errors, I re-discovered web design/programming,
  something I had taken a class in high school. I am now on the path
  to be a self-taught, front end developer. When I'm not working
  my current job or staring at a computer screen, I love getting
  out in the mountains to hike or (preferably) climb. I have also
   been skateboarding for more than half my life and still like
   to feel the concrete erase away my skin from time to time.
